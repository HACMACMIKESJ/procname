Overview:

procname is a simple LD_PRELOAD library that sets the process name on
Linux to the name specified in the environment variable PROCNAME.  This
allows Java programs to show up in "top" or "ps acux" as their logical
name rather than the generic "java".  It could also be useful for other
language runtimes such as Python or Ruby.

Usage:

Run Java with the LD_PRELOAD and PROCNAME environment variables set:

LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libprocname.so PROCNAME=hello java -jar foo.jar
